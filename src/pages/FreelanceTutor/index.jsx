        <p>
          I have been a teacher for 20 years... As I move away from teaching in
          the traditional education setting and into Web Development, I would
          like to offer my services as a Tutor. I started out my teaching career
          as a PE Teacher. I then taught the 7-13 age range Maths to Common
          Entrance 13+, Geography and PE for 8 years. I moved to Spain then, and
          taught Spanish students a whole range of subjects in a British School.
          This was an amazing experience, including Teaching English as a
          Foreign Language on Saturdays. When I moved back to England I moved
          towards secondary Maths Teaching, Geography and Animal Care.
