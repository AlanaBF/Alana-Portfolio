            I am a former teacher turned Front End Developer. I took a massive
            leap of faith to leave teaching after 20 years and embark on a
            completely new chapter in my life!
          </p>
          <p className="about-text">
            After completing a rigorous 16-week intensive bootcamp in Front End
            Web Development through the government-funded program with EdX
            Trilogy Skills, I have made a career change possible. This
            transformative journey has enabled me to discover a sector that I'm
            passionate about.
          </p>
          <p className="about-text">
            More recently, I have completed the West Midlands Digital Skills
            Academy with Version 1. This program has provided me with a diverse
            range of valuable skills and knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have now started as a permanent member of the team as an Associate
            Consultant. My first project is allowing me to learn the Business
            Analyst and AI Engineer Roles in greater detail. As I embark on this
            exciting trajectory, I'm excited to contribute my skills and
            creativity to the ever-evolving landscape of technology, harnessing
            my background in education to bring a unique perspective to my
            endeavors in the tech world.
          </p>

            As part of my transition and sharing my story I have also started to
            blog my journey of teacherturnsturtle{" "}
