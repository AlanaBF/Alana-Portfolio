            Former Teacher turned Front End Developer, always learning and
            seeking new knowledge and skills. Very excited to bring highly
            transferable and relevant skillset into the Tech Sector. I value a
            simple and clean approach and donâ€™t like to over complicate tasks. A
            leader, mentor, effective planner and implementor of organization
            strategies to balance day to day teaching requirements alongside
            extra curricular activities.
