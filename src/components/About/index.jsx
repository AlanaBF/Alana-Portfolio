          <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
          <p className="about-text">
            As a former teacher turned Front End Developer, I've discovered a
            profound connection between teaching and coding â€“ the power to
            shape, influence, and inspire. Armed with an insatiable thirst for
            knowledge, I eagerly delve into the depths of the Tech Sector, ready
            to unleash my highly transferable skills and bring a simple, clean,
            and elegant touch to the digital realm.
          </p>
          <p className="about-text">
            In my journey, I've learned that leadership isn't just about leading
            from the front; it's about being a mentor, an effective planner, and
            an implementor of strategies that create harmony between daily
            demands.

            After completing a rigorous 16-week intensive bootcamp in Front End
            Web Development through the government-funded program with EdX
            Trilogy Skills, I have achieved a remarkable transition from the
            field of teaching to the dynamic realm of technology. This
            transformative journey has enabled me to discover a sector that
            resonates deeply with my passions. The immersive experience provided
            by the bootcamp has not only equipped me with a robust skill set in
            web development but has also ignited a newfound enthusiasm for the
            tech industry. This leap signifies a significant personal and
            professional accomplishment, as I've successfully navigated a
            challenging learning path and emerged with the capabilities needed
            to excel in my newfound passion. As I embark on this exciting
            trajectory, I'm excited to contribute my skills and creativity to
            the ever-evolving landscape of technology, harnessing my background
            in education to bring a unique perspective to my endeavors in the
            tech world.

            But the journey doesn't end here. As I embark on the West Midlands
            Digital Skills Academy and Early Career Path with Version 1, I'm
            delving deeper into the frontiers of innovation, conquering new
            horizons, and pushing the boundaries of my IT expertise.

            This program has provided me with a diverse range of valuable skills
            and knowledge. I've delved into the intricacies of Linux as an
            operating system, gaining a solid foundation in its mechanics and
            functionalities. The Agile Fundamentals module has equipped me with
            an understanding of agile methodologies and their application in
            project management. With hands-on experience on GitHub, I've honed
            my version control and collaboration skills, essential for modern
            development practices. The Storytelling for Business course has
            taught me the art of conveying complex ideas effectively, vital for
            successful communication in professional settings. My venture into
            Cyber Security has not only imparted insights into fortifying
            digital assets and privacy but has also kindled a heightened
            awareness of potential threats. In the realm of Business Analysis,
            I'm learning to decipher business needs and translate them into
            technical solutions. Additionally, my exposure to Azure is deepening
            my understanding of cloud services. Cementing my knowledge with
            exams in Cyber Security and Azure 900, I'm confident that my
            enriched skill set will serve as a strong foundation for my future
            endeavors in this digital landscape.
