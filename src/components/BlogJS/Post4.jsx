              ðŸŒŸ Throughout the 30-day journey, Wes Bos takes you on a hands-on
              adventure, building 30 real-life projects using nothing but
              Vanilla JavaScript. From drum kits to clock widgets, each project
              is designed to teach you fundamental JavaScript concepts while
              also honing your coding skills. What sets this course apart is Wes
              Bos's teaching style. His clear explanations, insightful tips, and
              encouraging demeanor make learning JavaScript not only accessible

              Personally, I found myself challenged in the best possible way,
              pushing my boundaries and expanding my understanding of JavaScript
              with each project. And the best part? I walked away with a
              portfolio of projects to showcase my newfound skills.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of these are in their infancy or the same code as from the
              course and need A LOT of further development to personalise them. However I'm pleased with my achievements so far and wanted to show
              what you can learn in a month.

              I also really enjoyed the challenges around voice synthesis, web
              cam fun, custom video player, speech detection and geolocation. In
              fact I loved the whole lot but those in particular have sparked a
              whole wave of ideas and inspiration for new apps! Here is a taster
