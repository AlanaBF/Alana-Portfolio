              Personally, I found myself challenged in the best possible way,
              pushing my boundaries and expanding my understanding of JavaScript
              with each project. And the best part? I walked away with a
              portfolio of projects to showcase my newfound skills.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of these are in their infancy or the same code as from the
              course and need A LOT of further development to personalise them. However I'm pleased with my achievements so far and wanted to show
              what you can learn in a month.

              I also really enjoyed the challenges around voice synthesis, web
              cam fun, custom video player, speech detection and geolocation. In
              fact I loved the whole lot but those in particular have sparked a
              whole wave of ideas and inspiration for new apps! Here is a taster
              of them in Vanilla JavaScript form as taught on JavaScript30 with
