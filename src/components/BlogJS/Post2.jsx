              Thank you to Version 1 for this awesome opportunity as I embark on
              my career as an Associate Consultant on their Accelerate Digital
              Academy. I begin my journey with 12 weeks of training followed by
              18 months assigned to a Version 1 Team. My first week starts on
              the 10th July 2023 with 2 company days at the Redditch Office.{" "}

              Embracing the Challenge Leaving behind a comfortable teaching
              career and stepping into the unfamiliar territory of the tech
              industry was undoubtedly a daunting decision. However, I
              recognized the challenges and decided to face them head-on. The
              competitive job market didn't deter me; instead, it fueled my
              determination to make a mark in the tech world.

                Investing in myself to give myself the best chance of success

            </h5>
            <p>
              I understood the importance of acquiring relevant skills and
              certifications. I enrolled in a government-funded Skills For Life
              bootcamp in Front End Web Development, which provided me with a
              solid foundation in this field. Additionally, I completed
              certifications in Prince2 Project Management and AgilePM,
              expanding my skill set and making myself more versatile.

            <p>
              I actively sought opportunities to network with professionals in

              to experts, and engaged with experienced individuals who provided
              invaluable insights and advice for success. Learning from those
              who have already walked the path was instrumental in shaping my
              approach.
