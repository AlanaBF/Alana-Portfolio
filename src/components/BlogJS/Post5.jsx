              So, I innocently embarked on what I thought would be a simple
              journey to spruce up my portfolio with my recent Javascript30

            <p>Oh, how wrong I was! </p>
            <p>
              Next thing I knew, I stumbled upon the possibility of animating my
              Avatar with an .fbx file. Easy peasy, right? Wrong. Cue an email
              to the support team and a descent into the world of Unity. How
              hard could it be? Let's just say, my optimism quickly turned into
              a series of üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§Øüò± moments. After countless YouTube tutorials,
              problem-solving sessions, and time spent in the Unity abyss, I
              finally managed to bring my Avatar to life.{" "}
            </p>
            Cue the happy dance!

              But of course, one rabbit hole always leads to another. Now, I'm
              not just satisfied with an animated Avatar‚ÄîI want to give the
              background some pizzazz too! But let's save that for another day,
              shall we? Right now, the priority is figuring out how to integrate
              this masterpiece into my portfolio. More rabbit holes
              ensued‚ÄîGoogle searches, npm install of Unity React WebGL. But with
              determination rivaling that of a marathon runner, I prevailed.
              With a sense of triumph, I hit "npm run dev," and voila! It
              worked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Style it with a border, add, commit, deploy to GitHub‚Äîeasy peasy,
              right? Wrong again. Parsing error! More rabbit holes, more
              searching, and finally, a solution. Don't gz zip it. Slower, but
              it works. Cue another happy dance, followed by a
              well-deserved eye break.

              Through this wild adventure, I've realised a couple of things:
              firstly, I may have a touch of OCD when it comes to completing
              tasks (or am I just stubborn ü§îü§ì?). Secondly, problem-solving is
              my superpower‚Äîeven if it means diving headfirst into countless
              rabbit holes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course,I'm not done yet. The warren of rabbit holes I've built
              is still expanding and progress is progress, right? It's hard to
              believe that after two decades of teaching Geography, PE, and
              Maths, I've made a 180-degree turn into the world of coding with
              zero prior knowledge. I used to think websites were magical
              entities that just appeared out of thin air. But now, I've seen
              the sweat, tears, and late-night debugging sessions behind the
              curtain, and I'm hooked. Here's to embracing the chaos and loving
              every minute of it! ü•∞
