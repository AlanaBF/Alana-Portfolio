            So, I innocently embarked on what I thought would be a simple
            journey to spruce up my portfolio with my recent Javascript30 course
            and … an Avatar.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Little did I know, I was about to fall into a rabbit hole so deep,
            even Alice would be impressed!
          </p>
          <p>
            It all started with a Ready Player Me Avatar. "Cool," I thought,
            "this will jazz up my portfolio nicely." Following the GitHub
            instructions, I added it in, thinking I was done.
          </p>
          <p>Oh, how wrong I was! </p>
          <p>
            Next thing I knew, I stumbled upon the possibility of animating my
            Avatar with an .fbx file. Easy peasy, right? Wrong. Cue an email to
            the support team and a descent into the world of Unity. How hard
            could it be? Let's just say, my optimism quickly turned into a
            series of 😵‍💫🤯😱 moments. After countless YouTube tutorials (big
            thank you to @Dinesh Punni), problem-solving sessions, and time
            spent in the Unity abyss, I finally managed to bring my Avatar to
            life.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>Cue the happy dance!</p>
          <div>
            <iframe
              src="https://giphy.com/embed/EPSFKT1angXDO"
              width="100%"
              height="100%"
              class="giphy-embed"
              allowFullScreen
            ></iframe>
          </div>
          <p>
            But of course, one rabbit hole always leads to another. Now, I'm not
            just satisfied with an animated Avatar, I wanted to give the
            background some pizzazz too! Ok, step too far for now. Parked it and
            saved for another day. Right now, the priority is figuring out how
            to integrate this masterpiece into my portfolio. More rabbit holes
            ensued, Google searches and finally an npm install of
            Unity-React-WebGL. With determination rivalling that of a marathon
            runner (absolutely not a runner!), I prevailed. With a sense of
            triumph, I hit "npm run dev," and voila! It worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Style it with a border, add, commit, deploy to GitHub—easy peasy,
            right?
          </p>
          <p>Wrong again. </p>
          <p>Parsing error! </p>{" "}
          <p>
            Arghhhhhh... More rabbit holes, more searching, and finally, a
            solution. Don't gz zip it. Slower, but it works. Cue another happy
            dance, followed by a well-deserved eye break.

            Through this wild adventure, I've realised a couple of things:
            firstly, I may have a touch of OCD when it comes to completing tasks
            (or am I just stubborn 🤔🤓?). Secondly, problem-solving is my
            superpower—even if it means diving headfirst into countless rabbit
            holes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I'm not done yet. The warren of rabbit holes I've built
            is still expanding and progress is progress, right? It's hard to
            believe that after two decades of teaching Geography, PE, and Maths,
            I've made a 180-degree turn into the world of coding with zero prior
            knowledge. I used to think websites were magical entities that just
            appeared out of thin air. But now, I've seen the sweat, tears, and
            late-night debugging sessions behind the curtain, and I'm hooked.
            Here's to embracing the chaos and loving every minute of it! 🥰
